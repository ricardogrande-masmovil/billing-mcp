To get started with the Billing MCP Server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ricardogrande-masmovil/billing-mcp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd billing-mcp
   ```

   go mod tidy
   ```

##Â Setup an MCP client
To set up an MCP client, you will need the following config:
```json
{
    "servers": {
        "billing": {
            "type": "sse",
            "url": "http://localhost:8080/sse"
        }
    }
}
```
You can change the URL to point to your server's address if it's not running locally. This configuration works directly in VSCode, enabling you to test the server's functionality by using the agent chat mode.
